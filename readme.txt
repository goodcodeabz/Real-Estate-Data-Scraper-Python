Web scraping program that uses BeautifulSoup library that scraps real estate data from the website. 
Then we store the data as a Dictionary  in a list. 
Then we used Pandas library to import the data frame to a csv file, for easy data analysis.

Requirement::

If the website has changed or moved, then the current code wont work. You might have to update the tags or the link itself.
